# vaultwarden-dev (Agent Plugins 1.0)

Vaultwarden dev plugin for Agents Store. Script and integrate a self-hosted Vaultwarden (Bitwarden-compatible) server: what the client API can and cannot do under end-to-end encryption, the identity token flows, organization member management, the /admin panel API, the Bitwarden CLI (bw, bw serve), python-vaultwarden and Terraform, client/server version compatibility, troubleshooting, and a guard hook that asks before a command prints decrypted secrets into the chat. File-based knowledge, no MCP, no stored credentials.

## Install

Vendor-neutral plugin per the [Agent Plugins 1.0](https://agent-plugins.org) standard — supported by ChatGPT, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Kiro, and VS Code. Follow your client's plugin-install flow and point it at this directory.

## Components

- 9 skill(s) under `skills/`
- No MCP server
- agents/commands/hooks preserved verbatim under `com.anthropic.claude-code/` (outside Agent Plugins v1 — only clients that understand this namespace will use them)

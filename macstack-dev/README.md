# macstack-dev (Agent Plugins 1.0)

MACSTACK dev plugin for Agents Store. Creates and maintains macstack.json — the standardized business + technical stack specification for Claude projects: init in existing projects, generate from scratch (result-first), discover context plugins and prototypes, scaffold project files in the prototype → stack plugins → dev plugins order, wire Infisical env, install best-practice rules and commands.

## Install

Vendor-neutral plugin per the [Agent Plugins 1.0](https://agent-plugins.org) standard — supported by ChatGPT, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Kiro, and VS Code. Follow your client's plugin-install flow and point it at this directory.

## Components

- 11 skill(s) under `skills/`
- No MCP server
- agents/commands preserved verbatim under `com.anthropic.claude-code/` (outside Agent Plugins v1 — only clients that understand this namespace will use them)

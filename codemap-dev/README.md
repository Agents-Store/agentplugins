# codemap-dev (Agent Plugins 1.0)

Code understanding plugin for developers. Helps onboard to unfamiliar projects through beginner-friendly code review, step-by-step explanations, visual diagrams (architecture, ERD, flows) via drawio-mcp, and frontend testing via Playwright MCP.

## Install

Vendor-neutral plugin per the [Agent Plugins 1.0](https://agent-plugins.org) standard — supported by ChatGPT, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Kiro, and VS Code. Follow your client's plugin-install flow and point it at this directory.

## Components

- 5 skill(s) under `skills/`
- MCP server config in `mcp.json`
- agents/commands preserved verbatim under `com.anthropic.claude-code/` (outside Agent Plugins v1 — only clients that understand this namespace will use them)
